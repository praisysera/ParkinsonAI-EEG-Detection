# Parkinson-EEG-Detection
This project presents an AI-powered solution for the early detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using EEG signal analysis. Parkinsonâ€™s is a progressive neurological disorder, and early diagnosis is critical for effective symptom management. This project aims to bridge that gap using machine learning and deep learning models.

## Title of the project: 
### Leveraging EEG Signal Analysis and Machine Learning for Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease: A Comprehensive Approach

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

Parkinsonâ€™s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that impacts movement and coordination. Early detection is crucial but often delayed due to reliance on clinical observations. This project uses **EEG data** and **AI algorithms** to automate and enhance PD detection accuracy. It compares models such as **Logistic Regression**, **PCA+ML**, **ANN**, and **CNN**, with CNN achieving an **highest accuracy**.
