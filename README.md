# ParkinsonAI-EEG-Detection
This project presents an AI-powered solution for the early detection of Parkinson’s Disease using EEG signal analysis. Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological disorder, and early diagnosis is critical for effective symptom management. This project aims to bridge that gap using machine learning and deep learning models.
